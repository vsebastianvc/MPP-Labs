a) ->  the compilation error happens at  the line: List<Number> nums = ints; 
	   because this is no inheritance relationship between  List<Number> and  List<Integer>
	   
b) ->  the compilation error happens at  the line: "List<Integer> ints = ArrayList<>();" because don't have "new". 
 	   in other hand, at the line "nums.add(3.14);",because nums is refereaced to List<Integer>
