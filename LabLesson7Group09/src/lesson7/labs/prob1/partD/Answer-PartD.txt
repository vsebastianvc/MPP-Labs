They are incorrect because the removeDuplicates method uses Hashmap and when the Hascode of the object is not found, 
the setVisited method of the Employee class changes the value of the attribute "visited" the type boolean, this makes the object can not be found 
and finally returns false.

Solution: comment the line "&& emp.visited == visited" on the method equals() in the class Employee and too the line "result += 31 * result + (visited ? 1 : 0)" on the method hasCode()
