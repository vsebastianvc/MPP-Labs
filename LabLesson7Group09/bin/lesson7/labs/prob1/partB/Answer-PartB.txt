
The equals method in Employee has not been correctly overridden, because in its signature is receiving an Employee 
parameter (must be Object type). So the listsAreEqual method is calling the Equals method of the Object class, producing
an incorrect result.

Solution: Change the employee type for Object type in the Equals method. Additionally, Equals method from Employee class 
doesn’t validate null values. Doesn’t validate both objects were from the same class either.
